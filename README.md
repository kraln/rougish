A throwback rogue-alike that runs in a browser. 

Story 
----- 
You're a teenager in a small village in rural England at the dawn of the 15th century. The village elders have been preparing you since birth for the screening ritual. This past week, you've successfully passed the written screen, the oral screen, and the heritage screen. There's just one screen left: the game screen. 

In the middle of the night, the elders took you from your house and threw you down into the dank catacombs underlying the village. The eldest, a man wizened and frail, peers down into the darkness and begins to give you some last advice. Find the flashlight, find the ladder. Avoid Grumpus. 

The entire game depends on this last, one, screen. 

Can you survive and emerge victorious? Good luck!
